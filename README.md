Cloud Computing refers to accessing computing services like servers, storage, networking, and computing power as needed, without direct user management. It involves 
renting resources from another company's computers and only paying for what is used.

Amazon Web Services (AWS) provides a wide range of cloud computing services known for their flexibility, reliability, scalability, user-friendliness, and 
cost-effectiveness. These services include infrastructure as a service, platform as a service, and software as a service offerings.

I plan to showcase various projects I have successfully implemented in a production environment in my GitHub repository. These projects will demonstrate my 
experience with AWS products and services.
